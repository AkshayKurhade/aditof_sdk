eeprom-tool specs

specify target:

-u, --usb -> try to perform operation on a camera connected via usb
-e, --ethernet <ip> -> try to perform operations on a camera connected via ethernet at the specified ip
-m, --mipi -> try to perform operation on a camera connected locally

if nothing is specified the operations will be performed on the first camera returned by the enumerator


operations on target:
-r, --read <path_to_binary>  -> read the eeprom and dumps the contents in a file at the specified path

-w, --write <path_to_new_binary> -> validates the file
                                 -> write the new file

misc:
-v, --validate <path_to_binary> -> validates a given binary
                                -> prints the version
