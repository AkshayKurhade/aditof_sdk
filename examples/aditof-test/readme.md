# aditof-test sample code

## Overview

aditof-test is an example that can detect an 8X8 checkerboard image and display the results using openCV libraries.

In order for the lasest frame (both IR and DEPTH image) to be saved as well as the measured distance,
the cmake command must contain -DDATA_HANDLING=1
