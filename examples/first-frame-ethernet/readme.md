# first-frame-ethernet sample code

## Overview

The first-frame-ethernet is a cross platform sample code that shows how to use the aditof sdk to configure a camera over ip so that frames can be captured from it.
In order for this example to work, make sure the server is started on the target. For example if the ip of the target is `192.168.1.110` the run command should be:
`./first-frame-ethernet "192.168.1.110"`
