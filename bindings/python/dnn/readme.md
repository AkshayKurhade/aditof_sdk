# 3D Time of Flight : Python bindings

### Overview
This example  demonstrates object detection on the depth frame using the SSD Mobilenet object detection example from OpenCV and the Aditof SDK. It also shows how to compute and display IR frame.

It works with model taken from [MobileNet-SSD](https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD/). Building the project with CMake will download prototxt and caffemodel, used for object detection.
